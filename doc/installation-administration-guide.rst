------
OAuth2
------

This guide covers the installation of the OAuth2 CKAN extension v0.7.0, compatible with the software provided
as part of the FIWARE release 7.

Installation
++++++++++++

To install the extension in CKAN, it is required to activate the CKAN virtual environment as follows: ::

    $ . /usr/lib/ckan/default/bin/activate

.. note::
   The previous command is supposing that your CKAN virtualenv is in /usr/lib/ckan/default

The OAuth2 extension is available in pip and can be installed as follows: ::

    $ pip install ckanext-oauth2==0.7.0

If you want to install the extension for development, you can download it with the following commands: ::

    $ git clone https://github.com/conwetlab/ckanext-oauth2
    $ cd ckanext-oauth2
    $ git checkout v0.7.0

Once the extension has been downloaded and the virtualenv has been activated, the extension can be installed with the
following command: ::

    $ python setup.py develop

Configuration
+++++++++++++

To activate the OAuth2 extension in CKAN, it is required to include it in the *ckan.plugins* setting of the *.ini* file
(generally */etc/ckan/default/production.ini*). ::

    ckan.plugins = oauth2 <other-plugins>

Additionally, this extension requires a set of settings to be provided in the *.ini* file in order to configure its
behaviour and the integration with the selected IdM. In particular, The following is an example of configuration for using FIWARE Keyrock v7.6.0: ::

    ## OAuth2 configuration
    ckan.oauth2.logout_url = /user/logged_out
    ckan.oauth2.register_url = http://YOUR_OAUTH_SERVICE/sign_up
    ckan.oauth2.reset_url = http://YOUR_OAUTH_SERVICE/users/password/new
    ckan.oauth2.edit_url = http://YOUR_OAUTH_SERVICE/idm/settings
    ckan.oauth2.authorization_endpoint = http://YOUR_OAUTH_SERVICE/oauth2/authorize
    ckan.oauth2.token_endpoint = http://YOUR_OAUTH_SERVICE/oauth2/token
    ckan.oauth2.profile_api_url = http://YOUR_OAUTH_SERVICE/user
    ckan.oauth2.client_id = CLIENT_ID
    ckan.oauth2.client_secret = YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
    ckan.oauth2.jwt.enable = false
    ckan.oauth2.scope = all_info
    ckan.oauth2.rememberer_name = auth_tkt
    ckan.oauth2.profile_api_user_field = username
    ckan.oauth2.profile_api_fullname_field = username
    ckan.oauth2.profile_api_mail_field = email
    ckan.oauth2.authorization_header = Bearer

With the following meaning:

* **logout_url**: URL used in CKAN for logging out the user
* **register_url**: URL in the selected IDM for registering users
* **reset_url**: URL in the selected IDM for resetting user password
* **edit_url**: URL in the selected IDM for updating user info
* **authorization_endpoint**: URL in the selected IDM for retrieving authorization code in the OAuth2 process.
* **token_endpoint**: URL in the selected IDM for retrieving the access token in the OAuth2 process
* **profile_api_url**: URL in the selected IDM for retrieving user info
* **client_id**: Client ID given by the IDM to the CKAN instance
* **jwt.enable**: Whether to use JSON Web Tokens to load user info
* **client_secret**: Client Secret given by the selected IDM for the CKAN instance
* **profile_api_user_field**: Name of the field which contains the user id within the user info object as provided by the IDM
* **profile_api_fullname_field**: Name of the field which contains the user display name within the user info object as provided by the IDM
* **profile_api_mail_field**: Name of the field which contains the user email within the user info object as provided by the IDM
* **authorization_header**: Type of header that will be used for accessing CKAN APIs using an access token for authentication


Version 0.7.0 of the extension supports the usage of JSON Web Tokens of both FIWARE Keyrock and JBoss Keycloak.
To enable JWT using Keyrock the following changes in the configuration are required: ::

    ckan.oauth2.jwt.enable = true
    ckan.oauth2.scope = jwt

On the other hand, the following is a valid configuration for Keycloak IDM: ::

    ckan.oauth2.logout_url = /user/logged_out
    ckan.oauth2.edit_url = http://YOUR_OAUTH_SERVICE/auth/realms/REALM/account
    ckan.oauth2.authorization_endpoint = http://YOUR_OAUTH_SERVICE/auth/realms/REALM/protocol/openid-connect/auth
    ckan.oauth2.token_endpoint = http://YOUR_OAUTH_SERVICE/auth/realms/REALM/protocol/openid-connect/token
    ckan.oauth2.profile_api_url = http://YOUR_OAUTH_SERVICE/auth/realms/REALM/protocol/openid-connect/userinfo
    ckan.oauth2.client_id = CLIENT_ID
    ckan.oauth2.client_secret = YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
    ckan.oauth2.jwt.enable = true
    ckan.oauth2.scope = profile email openid
    ckan.oauth2.profile_api_user_field = user_name
    ckan.oauth2.profile_api_mail_field = email
    ckan.oauth2.authorization_header = Bearer
    ckan.oauth2.profile_api_fullname_field = user_name

It is important to note that this extension has been designed by default to be used in a CKAN deployed in HTTPS, so trying
to use it in an unsecured CKAN instance will result in an error. To use this extension in a not secured instance it is
required to set the *OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT* environment variable to true: ::

    $ export OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT=True

Or if CKAN is deployed in Apache, modifying */etc/apache2/envvars*

Finally, the callback URL that must be used in the IDM for registering CKAN is: ::

    https://YOUR_CKAN_INSTANCE/oauth2/callback
